DESCRIPTION
 this is an implementation of the Lapis nX-u8/u16 test protocol (over the TEST0
 and TEST1/RESET pins) for the Basys3 devboard. may be possible to port to other
 boards but you may have to change the constraints / build script / clock
 timings accordingly.
FILES
 fpga/ => fpga bitstream / sources
 interface/ => python interface with the fpga
USAGE
 COMPILING THE BITSTREAM
  - install bubblewrap for build sandboxing (sudo apt-get install bubblewrap)
  - make sure Vivado is installed and you have sourced settings64.sh
  - run make
 PROGRAMMING THE BITSTREAM
  - use the Hardware Manager in Vivado (if you are using the prebuilt
    bitstream you can use Lab Edition)
 CONNECTING TO AN MCU
  - connect the MCU debug clock (marked TEST1 or RESET) to JA1
  - connect the MCU debug data (marked TEST0 or TEST) to JA2
  - run read_chipid.py with the serial port of the board as the output. you
    should receive something that looks reasonable as a chip ID
